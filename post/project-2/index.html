    <div class="nested-copy-line-height lh-copy serif f4 nested-links mid-gray pr4-l w-two-thirds-l"><p>The Social Service department at Tecnológico de Monterrey is responsible for overseeing various Socio Formative Organizations and the experiences they offer to students. Their primary objective is to foster mutual satisfaction and well-being between these organizations and the students. To gauge the emotional state of students at the conclusion of their academic period, the department employs a survey to monitor their sentiments.</p>
<p>Currently, the organization possesses the survey results; however, it is evident that they have made limited progress in analyzing them. Several factors complicate the analysis process, such as the disparity in questions across different databases corresponding to various academic periods. Furthermore, the presence of null values, data gaps, contradictory responses, and similar challenges add further complexity to the analysis.</p>
<p>The proposed solution involves utilizing machine learning techniques to address the aforementioned problem. Our approach suggests the development of a predictive model based on sentiment analysis to accurately predict numerical values of responses, eliminating the need for manual sentiment analysis, therefore saving time and computational resources.</p>
<p>It is important to emphasize that machine learning is integral to the proposed solution, as it enables the development of predictive models and clustering algorithms capable of efficiently processing large volumes of data, extracting relevant patterns, and presenting the results in a user-friendly manner. This automation and learning capability significantly enhance the efficiency, accuracy, and usability of the solution, providing a strong value proposition and empowering informed and strategic decision-making within the realm of the service that is offered.</p>
<p>To ensure clear and accessible visualization of the results, a dashboard will be created. This dashboard will present the sentiment analysis and identified clusters, offering effectively processed information that adds value to decision-making processes.</p>
<p>The objectives are as follows:</p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> Develop an easily comprehensible dashboard for the users and clients of the Social Service department, aiming to enhance the service provided.</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> Implement a pre-trained model that eliminates the necessity of manually conducting sentiment analysis for each response to open-ended questions, utilizing the data already received.</p>
<p><strong>3.</strong> Create a visually clear interface with various colors and incorporate data filtering capabilities to facilitate user understanding. This will enable users to make informed decisions that generate value for the training partner&rsquo;s organization.</p>
<p>After carrying out a series of crucial steps including dataset description, data exploration, data quality assessment, data selection, data cleaning, data transformation, and feature extraction, the next phase involved testing and comparing the performance of five different models. The objective was to identify the model that exhibited the highest level of accuracy, predictive power, and overall suitability for the given dataset. This rigorous testing process aimed to determine the best model that would effectively address the problem at hand and yield optimal results.</p>
<p>Various models, including the random forest regressor, support vector regressor, and neural network, were evaluated and their results compared. It is crucial to emphasize that the goal was to predict the sentiment analysis value based on other variables, making it the target variable.</p>
<p>Additionally, it is noteworthy that each algorithm was executed five times, with various modifications made during each run. This approach aimed to explore different configurations and parameters to ensure a comprehensive evaluation of the models&rsquo; performance.</p>

<p>With this in mind and considering the needs of the project, it is established that the neural network is the best model to predict the target variable.
It should be clarified that with the neural network there is online training, meaning that the data is analyzed in small batches and in real time, updating parameters continuously, allowing adaptability, efficiency in the use of resources, meaningful results and in real time.</p>
<p>With the help of our classifier model that can predict the degree of satisfaction of the experiences provided by OSF, it will be possible to make informed decisions about the Social Services offered by the organization and accurately measure the vulnerabilities of the projects. With this, we will be able to improve so that in future social service experiences students will increase their level of satisfaction and at the same time motivate many more people to be part of the Social Service offered by OSF and support our society.</p>
<figure class="center"><img src="https://valeriasernasalazar.github.io/ValeriaSerna_Portfolio/images/sdg.png"/>
</figure>

<p>For the deployment of the results, an interactive dashboard is proposed, which is based on the predictions made by the neural network. It is important to note that the neural network focuses on predicting user satisfaction with the Socio Formative Organization (OSF) based on the multiple-choice responses.</p>
<p>At the end, the dataset used for generating the dashboard contains the survey date, the name of the evaluated OSF, and the neural network&rsquo;s predictions for questions 4 and 6. Therefore, it consists of only four columns. The dashboard was developed using Streamlit, a framework for creating data-driven applications. It is interactive, has filters, and is a great way to visualize the data.</p>

<p>In conclusion, this dashboard provides the Socio Formative Organization (OSF) with a user-friendly tool to better understand the responses of the students. It offers a comprehensive overview of how students feel about the social service they have undertaken, thereby facilitating the decision-making process for the organization&rsquo;s management. This tool enables them to gain insights into student experiences and make informed decisions regarding the next steps to be taken.</p>
<p>Some recommendations for the Social Service department&rsquo;s management include:</p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> Use a customer satisfaction prediction model to identify areas for improvement in social service experiences. By analyzing the predicted ratings provided by the model, adjustments can be made to enhance the quality and overall experience for students. This may involve tailoring interactions with Socio Formative Organizations (OSFs) to meet their specific needs, such as offering personalized promotions, tailored recommendations, and focused communications. This approach aims to increase satisfaction and foster loyalty among students, ensuring a positive experience within the social service programs and motivating more individuals to participate.</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> Establish a continuous feedback and improvement cycle to make the most of the information provided by the prediction model. Regularly collecting data and feedback from students and OSFs will help keep the model updated and aligned with changing needs. Additionally, using this data to generate detailed reports and analyses on the satisfaction of the OSFs will provide a holistic view of the strengths and weaknesses of the social service program. This valuable information can be used to develop specific training programs for OSFs, provide personalized recommendations, and promote growth and continuous improvement in all areas related to social service.</p>
<p>By implementing these recommendations, the quality of the social service provided to OSFs can be improved, fostering stronger relationships with them and creating an enriching experience for students. Moreover, it cultivates a culture of continuous improvement in all aspects related to social service.</p>
<p>The next steps include:</p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> Continue working on improving the existing models, refining their predictive capabilities and optimizing their performance. This involves making adjustments and regular updates to ensure that the models remain accurate and relevant as new data is collected.</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> Implement an agglomerative clustering model in the dashboard, which will allow for the identification of groups sharing similarities. This will provide an additional and enriching perspective to the data analysis by highlighting patterns and trends within user responses.</p>
<p><strong>3.</strong> Keep using the dashboard as a comprehensive tool for efficiently and effectively visualizing the data. This entails leveraging the filtering and data segmentation capabilities to gain deeper insights into the responses and enable informed and strategic decision-making.</p>
<p>I consider the achieved results thus far as satisfactory, having successfully completed a comprehensive data analysis, developed a predictive model, and provided an efficient data visualization solution. However, it is recognized that there is room for improvement, and efforts will be made to further evolve and expand the capabilities of the dashboard to deliver an even more comprehensive proposal in future reports and analyses.</p>

    <div class="nested-copy-line-height lh-copy serif f4 nested-links mid-gray pr4-l w-two-thirds-l"><p>Founded in 1943, Tecnológico de Monterrey is a renowned university with a strong presence across 26 diverse campuses. With a student body of approximately 100,000 individuals, the institution continues to provide quality education and a vibrant learning environment for its students. TecStore was created with the objective of &ldquo;fostering pride, a sense of belonging and promoting the Tec spirit through official products, as well as the creation of new experiences that connect the Tecnológico de Monterrey community with its brand.&rdquo; (Tec, 2015). Inspired by American universities, it opened its first physical store in 2016 in Monterrey and, currently, there are 10 points of sale in Mexico, in addition to its online store. The latter, served as a fundamental piece to maintain stable sales and even potentialize them after the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic in March 2020.</p>
<figure class="center"><img src="https://valeriasernasalazar.github.io/ValeriaSerna_Portfolio/images/tecstore1.jpeg"/>
</figure>

<p>The objective of this project is to analyze a database that arises from the summary of orders on TecStore&rsquo;s online page and to observe, in such a way, the behavior of the customers. Thus, it is possible to propose concrete actions based on the needs and demands of the consumer, to ensuring a continuous improvement of the service offered.
By visualizing data, we seek to obtain information that is easy to understand, facilitates the recognition of patterns, and helps company managers to make informed decisions about specific situations that arise. Today, the analysis by the regional manager is presented.</p>
<p>After a comprehensive data cleaning, understanding, and transformation process on the provided database, the final product was developed. It is worth noting that the original information was in Spanish, and the final deliverable was presented in the same language. While efforts have been made to translate the dashboard, a few Spanish terms may still be recognizable, this includes the currency and other aspects involved. I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.</p>
<figure class="center"><img src="https://valeriasernasalazar.github.io/ValeriaSerna_Portfolio/images/dash2.png"/>
</figure>

<p>The objective of the dashboard is to observe sales and best-selling products by state and look for ways to improve the numbers. The first part is facilitated by the dashboard created because, by using filters, you can see from the most purchased product, along with its subtotal, to the times when people usually enter the page.</p>
<p>The combination of different graphs and statistical techniques allows us to observe the behavior of the data and the way in which different approaches to the same situation allow for a more complete analysis. To begin with, it was observed that the state with the highest sales is Nuevo León, a situation that makes sense since it was the first institution to open its doors in 1943. On the other hand, the states with the lowest sales are Zacatecas and Coahuila.</p>
<p>Something interesting that was analyzed was the most sold product because, regardless of geographic location, it is always sweatshirts; an example of this is Coahuila, which only has $2,069 in sales but all of them are for this specific product. Something else that was identified is that the male gender corresponds to 55% of the clientele, the female to 40% and purchases without defined gender to 5%.</p>
<p>On the other hand, with respect to the domain services.itesm.mx, itesm.mx or tec.mx are the most common, meaning that purchases are made by students, collaborators and professors. It is worth mentioning that in the state of Nuevo Leon, for the female gender and for the unspecified gender the domain of servicios.itesm.mx does not show importance in the pie chart, while in the male gender, it occupies more than 50% of it. This shows that the Tec collaborators in charge of to make product purchases tend to be men.</p>
<p>Finally, it is known that the Covid-19 pandemic has been a cause of various psychological factors and illnesses, one of these being insomnia and its relationship to the anxiety of the virus. This topic is explored in articles such as &ldquo;The acute effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on insomnia and psychological symptoms&rdquo; published by Laval University in Canada, &ldquo;COVID-19 is wrecking our sleep with coronasomnia - tips to fight back&rdquo; by UCDavis, etc. The above, it is possible to observe in the graph created because, if you filter the data in the years of 2018 and 2019, before the onset of the pandemic, sales in the hour range of 12 to 5 am were $215,000 while, in 2021 and 2022, it jumped exponentially to almost 1.4 million pesos in purchases. This reflects a growth of 551,163%, which is exuberant and worth analyzing.</p>
<p>Based on the results obtained, the following measures are proposed:</p>
<ol>
<li>While observing that there are so many purchases in the state of Nuevo Leon, it os proposed to add a TecStore in each Tec high school campus in Monterrey and its surroundings, this would significantly boost merchandise purchases. Also, increase the amount of advertising in places that have a medium amount of sales, such as Mexico City or Jalisco. Thus, instead of looking for markets in places where they will not be found, the market that currently exists in some Mexican states can be exploited.</li>
<li>By identifying that the best-selling product is sweatshirts, it is proposed to increase the number of colors, patterns and designs, in order to attract even more customers and meet their needs. Also, noting that a very small number of customers are young people, one action is to create products for each race, in such a way as to encourage the purchase of teenagers.</li>
<li>Offer discounts and benefits to Tec employees (such as free shipping, 10% discount, etc.), since it was observed that this domain is the most used in almost all states.</li>
<li>Regarding the hours when the web page is most used, it is proposed to use the hours from 11 pm to 5 am to maintain the page and affect as few customers as possible. Likewise, to demonstrate that Tecnológico de Monterrey is an institution that cares about the mental health of students, professors, collaborators and clients in general, publish videos on social media with different relaxation and meditation tips to avoid insomnia.</li>
</ol>
<p>In conclusion, this project allowed me to see the way in which different graphs work together to create a more complete story, in addition, I was able to observe how data science can be applied to something as complex as a business that exists and, finally, I analyzed the correct way to use data to obtain concrete and essential results for the life of a company.
During the project, I managed to develop my logical, creative and methodical thinking because, although a part of mathematics and statistics is used, analyzing data is using numbers to tell a story that is coherent and complete.</p>
